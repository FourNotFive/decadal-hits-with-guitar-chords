# Guitar Chord Website Project - Progress Summary

**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Project Status:** Working Website Complete - Ready for Chord Integration  
**User Level:** Noob - Requires step-by-step guidance

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT GOAL
A **decade-based guitar chord website** where users browse Billboard hits by decade and see guitar chords.

## âœ… COMPLETED WORK

### Working Website
- **Live Flask web server** at `http://localhost:5000`
- **Decade navigation** (1950s-2020s) with real Billboard data
- **Top 50 songs per decade** with chart statistics
- **Professional UI** with smooth navigation

### Database Structure
- **`music_database.db`** (61.3 MB) contains:
  - `unique_songs` - 32,025 deduplicated Billboard songs
  - `top_songs_1960s`, `top_songs_1970s`, etc. - Top 50 per decade
  - `decade_summary` - Decade metadata
  - `mcgill_chord_data` - 890 chord progressions (unlinked)

### File Structure
```
Music_Project_Clean/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web_server.py (WORKING Flask server)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fixed_decade_analysis.py (creates decade tables)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ database_explorer.py (examines database)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/databases/music_database.db (main database)
```

## ðŸŽ¸ SAMPLE DATA WORKING
- **1960s**: "Hey Jude", "Monster Mash", "The Twist"
- **1990s**: "Macarena", "Smooth", "Amazed"  
- **2010s**: "Blinding Lights", "Radioactive", "Shape of You"

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL SETUP
- **Environment**: VS Code, Python 3.13, Windows PowerShell
- **Current directory**: `C:\Users\Arjan\Desktop\Music_Project_Clean`
- **Working commands**:
  ```bash
  cd scripts
  python web_server.py  # Start website
  ```

## ðŸš§ NEXT PHASE: CHORD INTEGRATION

### Immediate Goal
**Link McGill chord data to Billboard songs** so users can see actual guitar chords.

### Key Challenge
McGill data has **no artist/title info** - only McGill IDs like "0003", "0004". Need matching strategy.

### Database Status
- **Billboard songs**: Have artist + title, no chords
- **McGill chords**: Have chord progressions, no artist/title
- **Need**: Matching algorithm to connect them

## ðŸ“‹ FOR NEXT SESSION

### Context for New Assistant
1. **Working website exists** - user can browse decades and songs
2. **Need chord integration** - main missing piece
3. **User is noob** - requires step-by-step instructions
4. **VS Code setup** - all scripts in `scripts/` folder

### Quick Restart Commands
```bash
cd Music_Project_Clean/scripts
python web_server.py          # Launch working website
python database_explorer.py   # Check database structure
```

### Next Steps Needed
1. **Analyze McGill chord data structure** (what info is available?)
2. **Create matching algorithm** (McGill â†” Billboard songs)  
3. **Update website** to display chords when available
4. **Add chord diagrams** for guitar learning

## ðŸŽµ SUCCESS METRICS
- âœ… **32K+ songs organized** by decade
- âœ… **Working web interface** with real data
- âœ… **Professional UI** with smooth navigation
- ðŸ”² **Chord progressions displayed** for matched songs
- ðŸ”² **Guitar diagrams** for visual learning

## ðŸ’¡ KEY INSIGHTS
- **McGill has quality chord data** (890 songs, detailed progressions)
- **Billboard has the hit songs** people want to learn
- **Decade organization works well** for music discovery
- **Flask server handles data efficiently**

**Status: Foundation solid, ready for chord integration phase! ðŸŽ¸**
